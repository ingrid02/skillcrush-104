			<h4>You Can't and Won't be Perfect!</h4>
			<p>You cannot learn this stuff perfectly and get everything correct the first or even the second time you try.  Just learn the concepts and practice them.  It's ok to look at solution codes.</p>

			<p>The only thing that is perfect about learning to code is that you will perfectly be frustrated and confused and did i say frustrated?  It's normal. Everyone goes through this phase.  It's a new language just list Spanish or French....it really takes time.</p>

			<h4>Everyone learns differently.</h4>
			<p>Reading, Doing, Watching a video....we all have different ways of learning concepts.  I suggest using a combination of the modalities of learning because some things stick after seeing, doing or hearing while some just don't.  you don't know until you try them all.</p>

			<p>Also, it is acceptable to use more than one class at a time as supplement.  One course can't possbily teach you all nuances of coding.  Emphasis can be on differnt things depending on the course.  Multiple courses simultaneaously is ok.</p>

			<p>Hang in there and keep coding....like everyday....you'll make it.</p>
